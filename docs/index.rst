Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------

``hdlmake`` is supported in both 32 and 64 bits operating systems.

From version 3.0 onwards, ``hdlmake`` supports native Windows shells too,
so you don't need to cheat the system by using Cygwin like environments.

Installing ``hdlmake``
======================

Linux deployment
----------------

``hdlmake`` is a Python application and is distributed as an easy to build and deploy source code Python package. In order to run ``hdlmake`` as a shell command, the next process has to be followed.

As a prerequisite, you must have the following programs installed in your host machine:

- ``python``: you need a compatible Python deployment
- ``git``: you need git for both fetching the ``hdlmake`` code and accessing to remote HDL repositories.
- ``svn``: svn will only be used when accessing to remote SVN HDL repositories. 

.. note:: In order to support Python 2.7.x and 3.x with a single codebase, the ``six`` Python package is now required to run ``hdlmake`` 3.0 version.

There are two methods to obtain and install ``hdlmake``: via git repository or PyPI. PyPI is the preferred method if you are only interested in releases. Git may be preferred if you are a developer, or would like to stay in sync with active development.

PyPI and ``pip``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing ``hdlmake`` via PyPI is straightforward assuming that you have ``pip`` already installed in your local Python environment.

.. note:: For directions on installing ``pip`` see the `pip documentation <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_.

To install directly from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install hdlmake
   
Alternatively, if you have already downloaded a source distribution, you can install it as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install hdlmake-X.X.tar.gz

At this point, ``hdlmake`` is now installed into your active Python environment and can be run simply by executing ``hdlmake`` in your shell.

Git
~~~

Fetch the code from the official ``hdlmake`` git repository, that can be found at the next link:
- http://www.ohwr.org/projects/hdl-make/repository

Once you have a valid ``hdlmake`` source tree, you can install ``hdlmake`` into your Python site-packages directly via *setup.py install*:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   cd /path_to_hdlmake_sources/hdl-make
   python2.7 setup.py install
   
``hdlmake`` is now installed into your active Python environment and can be run simply by executing ``hdlmake`` in your shell.

As a developer, you may wish to avoid installing ``hdlmake`` directly into your site-packages, but can instead link directly to the sources instead:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   cd /path_to_hdlmake_sources/hdl-make
   python2.7 setup.py develop
   
Alternatively, you may choose to forgo installing anything in your Python environment and simply directly run from the source by creating a launch script.
Create a launch script in /usr/bin or any other available location at shell $PATH. You can name the script as you prefer so, by doing this, multiple ``hdlmake`` versions can easily be used in the same machine. In any case, in this documentation we will consider that the name for this launch script is just ``hdlmake``.

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/usr/bin/env bash
   PYTHONPATH=/path_to_hdlmake_sources/hdl-make python2.7 -m hdlmake $@

Once the launch script has been created, the appropriate execution rights must be set: 

.. code-block:: bash

   chmod +x /usr/bin/hdlmake

In the above examples the following nomenclature is used:

- ``python2.7`` is the executable of the Python deployment we want to use with ``hdlmake``.
- ``path_to_hdlmake_sources`` is the absolute path in which the ``hdlmake`` source code has been fetched.
- ``hdl-make`` is the name of the folder created when you checked out the repo.
- ``hdlmake`` is the actual hdlmake package (this is not binary or a file, this is folder name).

Windows specific guidelines
---------------------------

From the new 3.0 version onwards, ``hdlmake`` supports execution on native ``Windows`` shell, including both the old ``cmd`` and the new ``PowerShell``. In this section, you'll find instructions on how to install and configure the tool and the required versions of the programs (``Git`` and ``Make``).

Make
~~~~

Install ``GNU Make Win32``:

- https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/make/3.81

Then, we need to add to PATH system variable the Make bin folder, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   c:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin

Git
~~~

Install Git-scm for Windows. If the bin dir is not added to the PATH, you'll need it to update the system environmental variable.

- https://git-scm.com/download/win

Python
~~~~~~

Install Python (2.7 or 3.x) for Windows:

- https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

To make it available on the command line, add this to PATH (e.g. for Python 2.7):

.. code-block:: bash

   c:\Python27

Before running ``hdlmake 3.0``, you'll need to instal ``six`` package to work with Hdlmake (``six`` is required to support Python 2.7 and 3.x with a single code base).

We can install ``six`` by just using the ``pip`` tool that comes with the Python deployment:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install six


Install hdlmake package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install ``hdlmake`` using the Python installation mechanism:

.. code-block:: bash

   python setup.py install

And be sure the following directory is in the PATH, as it will contain ``hdlmake.exe``

.. code-block:: bash

   c:\Python27\scripts



Learn by example
================

As a companion of ``hdlmake``, we can find a folder containing some easy design examples that can serve us as both tests and design templates. This folder is named ``hdl-make/tests/``
and is automatically downloaded when the ``hdlmake`` git repository is fetched.


Overview
--------

Inside the ``tests`` folder, you'll find a project called ``counter``. This project has been specifically designed to serve as an easy template/test for the following features:

- Testbench simulation
- Bitstream synthesis
- Verilog/VHDL support

The first level of the ``counter`` directory structure is the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ tree -d -L 1 counter/
   counter/
   |-- modules
   |-- sim
   |-- syn
   |-- testbench
   `-- top

where each folder has the following role:

- ``modules`` contains the code of the design, a very simple 8-bit counter.
- ``sim`` contain a set of top manifests targeted to simulation by using different tools.
- ``syn`` contain a set of top manifests targeted to synthesis by using different tools.
- ``testbench`` contains a testbench for the design, covering the 8-bit counter.
- ``top`` contains a top module wrapper attaching the counter design to the pushbuttons & LEDs of a real FPGA design.

For each simulation or synthesis that can be executed, we have both Verilog and VHDL source codes for the module, testbench and top. So in every of the previous folder, we will have as children a verilog and an vhdl folder (note that ghdl only supports VHDL and iverilog only supports Verilog).


The simplest ``hdlmake`` module
-------------------------------

If we take a deeper look to the ``modules`` folder we find that we really have two different hdlmake modules, one describing the counter as Verilog and other as VHDL.

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ tree counter/modules/
   counter/modules/
   `-- counter
       |-- verilog
       |   |-- counter.v
       |   `-- Manifest.py
       `-- vhdl
           |-- counter.vhd
           `-- Manifest.py

Each of the modules contains a single file, so in the VHDL case the associated Manifest.py is just:

.. code-block:: python

   files = [
       "counter.vhd",
   ]

While in the Verilog one the Manifest.py is:

.. code-block:: python

   files = [
       "counter.v",
   ]

A basic testbench
-----------------

Now, if we focus on the ``testbench`` folder, we have again two modules, targeted to cover both the VHDL and the Verilog based counter modules we have just seen.

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ tree counter/testbench/
   counter/testbench/
   `-- counter_tb
       |-- verilog
       |   |-- counter_tb.v
       |   `-- Manifest.py
       `-- vhdl
           |-- counter_tb.vhd
           `-- Manifest.py

Each of the modules contains a single testbench file written in the appropriate language, but in order to define the real project structure, the Manifest.py must include a reference to the modules under test. Thus, in the case of VHDL, the Manifest.py is:

.. code-block:: python

   files = [
       "counter_tb.vhd",
   ]

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../modules/counter/vhdl" ],
   }

While in Verilog the Manifest.py is:

.. code-block:: python

   files = [
       "counter_tb.v",
   ]

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../modules/counter/verilog" ],
   }

Note that, in both cases, the children modules are ``local``.


Running a simulation
--------------------

Now, we have all that we need to run a simulation for our simple design. If we take a look to the ``sim`` folder contents, we see that there is one folder for each of the supported simulations tools:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ tree -d -L 1 counter/sim
   counter/sim
   |-- active_hdl
   |-- ghdl
   |-- isim
   |-- iverilog
   |-- modelsim
   |-- riviera
   `-- vivado

As an example, let's focus on the ``modelsim`` folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ tree counter/sim/modelsim/
   counter/sim/modelsim/
   |-- verilog
   |   `-- Manifest.py
   |-- vhdl
   |   `-- Manifest.py
   `-- vsim.do

We can see that there is a top Manifest.py for both Verilog and VHDL languages. In addition, we have a ``vsim.do`` file that contains Modelsim specific commands that are common for both HDL languages.

In the VHDL case, the top Manifest.py for Modelsim simulation is:

.. code-block:: python

   action = "simulation"
   sim_tool = "modelsim"
   sim_top = "counter_tb"

   sim_post_cmd = "vsim -do ../vsim.do -i counter_tb"

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../testbench/counter_tb/vhdl" ],
   }

And in the Verilog case, the associated Manifest.py is:

.. code-block:: python

   action = "simulation"
   sim_tool = "modelsim"
   sim_top = "counter_tb"

   sim_post_cmd = "vsim -do ../vsim.do -i counter_tb"

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../testbench/counter_tb/verilog" ],
   }

In both cases, we can see that the ``modules`` parameter points to the specific VHDL or Verilog testbench, while the other fields remain the same for both of the languages.

The following common top specific Manifest variables describes the simulation:

- ``action``: indicates that we are going to perform a simulation.
- ``sim_tool``: indicates that modelsim is going to be the simulation we are going to use.
- ``sim_top``: indicates the name of the top HDL entity/instance that is going to be simulated.
- ``sim_post_cmd``: indicates a command that must be issued after the simulation process has finnished.

Now, if we want to launch the simulation, we must follow the next steps. First, get into the folder containing the top Manifest.py we want to execute and run ``hdlmake`` without arguments. e.g. for VHDL:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ cd counter/sim/modelsim/vhdl
   user@host:~$ hdlmake

This generates a simulation Makefile that can be executed by issuing the well known ``make`` command. When doing this, the appropriated HDL files are compiled in order following the hierachy described in the modules/Manifest.py tree. Now, once the design is compiled, if we want to run an actual simulation we need to issue a specific Modelsim command:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ make
   user@host:~$ vsim -do ../vsim.do -i counter_tb

But, because we have already defined a post simulation command into the Manifest.py, the generated Makefile allows us to combine the compilation and the test run in a single command. In this way, the second command is not required:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ make

If everything goes well, a graphical viewer should appear showing the simulated waveform. Note that every simulation top Manifest.py in the ``sim`` folder includes a tool specific ``sim_post_command``, so all the simulations in this example can be generated by using the same simple command sequence that has been exposed here.


Constraining a design for synthesis
-----------------------------------

The ``top`` folder contains the a series of HDL files describing how to attach the counter design to the PushButtons & LEDs of real FPGA powered design. The set has been chosed so that we have an example of every FPGA vendor supported by the ``hdlmake`` tool.

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ tree -d -L 1 counter/top
   counter/top
   |-- brevia2_dk
   |-- cyclone3_sk
   |-- icestick
   |-- proasic3_sk
   |-- spec_v4
   `-- zedboard

If we focus on the ``spec_v4`` folder, we can see that we have the following contents:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ tree counter/top/spec_v4/
   counter/top/spec_v4/
   |-- spec_top.ucf
   |-- verilog
   |   |-- Manifest.py
   |   `-- spec_top.v
   `-- vhdl
       |-- Manifest.py
       `-- spec_top.vhd

We can see that we have two different modules, one for VHDL and one for Verilog, each one containing a top module that links the counter design module to the outer world. In addition, we have a common ``spec_top.ucf`` constraints file that defines the specific FPGA pins that are connected with each HDL design port.

In this way, the VHDL Manifest.py is:

.. code-block:: python

   files = [ "spec_top.vhd", "../spec_top.ucf" ]

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../modules/counter/vhdl" ],
   }

And the Verilog one is:

.. code-block:: python

   files = [ "spec_top.v", "../spec_top.ucf" ]

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../modules/counter/verilog" ],
   }


Synthesizing a bitstream
------------------------

Once we have a constrained design targeted to a real FPGA board, we can generate a valid bitstream configuration file that can be downloaded into the FPGA configuration memory. In order to do that, we can use ``hdlmake`` to generate a synthesis Makefile that is able to perform the complete process by running a step-by-step flow that starts with the project generation and ends with the bitstream compiling. The main advantage of this approach is that, when synthesizing complex designs, the process can be resumed if it fails or is halted and the already performed jobs don't need to be re-launched again.

The following are the different **target names** a synthesis Makefile may feature. The names are taken from Xilinx ISE, a synthesis tools that goes through all of the potential synthesis stages, but will apply to all other available tools too:

   - ``project``: Create the synthesis tool specific project.
   - ``synthesize``: Synthesize the HDL source code.
   - ``translate``: Translate to synthesis tool format.
   - ``map``: Map the translated design into FPGA building blocks.
   - ``par``: Execute Place & Route for the selected FPGA device.
   - ``bitstream``: Generate the bitstream for FPGA programming.

For each of the potential synthesis targets, a **Tool Command Language (TCL)** file will be created as a dependency in the Makefile. These TCL files include the tool specific commands that are then sourced to the selected tool to perform the different synthesis stages. We have chosen to use TCL files as the intermediate format as this is the de-facto standard language that has been selected by the FPGA vendors.

A TCL file associated to a specific synthesis stage can be generated without sourcing it to the tool by just calling Make with the associated target name (``project.tcl``, ``synthesize.tcl``, ``translate.tcl``, ``map.tcl``, ``par.tcl``, ``bitstream.tcl``). In this way, this files can be integrated into other custom development flows.

.. note:: note that we have an additional ``files.tcl`` target. This is a dependency target for the project, and includes the TCL commands that are required all of the different design files to the tool in an appropriated way.

As a quick-start for synthesis projects development, in the ``syn`` folder we can find examples of top ``Manifest.py`` targeted to perform a bitstream generation by using all of the synthesis tools supported by ``hdlmake``:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ tree -d -L 1 counter/syn
   counter/syn
   |-- brevia2_dk_diamond
   |-- cyclone3_sk_quartus
   |-- icestick_icestorm
   |-- proasic3_sk_libero
   |-- spec_v4_ise
   |-- spec_v4_planahead
   `-- zedboard_vivado

Note that we have a different tool associated to each of the different supported vendor specific FPGA boards. The only exception is the spec_v4 design, that can be synthesized by using both Xilinx ISE and Xilinx PlanAhead.

If we focus on the ``spec_v4_ise`` test case, we can see the following contents in the associated folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ tree -d -L 1 counter/syn/spec_v4_ise
   counter/syn/spec_v4_ise/
   |-- verilog
   |   `-- Manifest.py
   `-- vhdl
       `-- Manifest.py

As we can see, we have a top synthesis Manifest.py for Verilog and another one for VHDL. If we take a look to the VHDL Manifest.py, we have:

.. code-block:: python

   target = "xilinx"
   action = "synthesis"

   syn_device = "xc6slx45t"
   syn_grade = "-3"
   syn_package = "fgg484"
   syn_top = "spec_top"
   syn_project = "demo.xise"
   syn_tool = "ise"

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../top/spec_v4/vhdl" ],
   }

And for the Verilog synthesis top Manifest.py:

.. code-block:: python

   action = "synthesis"

   syn_device = "xc6slx45t"
   syn_grade = "-3"
   syn_package = "fgg484"
   syn_top = "spec_top"
   syn_project = "demo.xise"
   syn_tool = "ise"

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../top/spec_v4/verilog" ],
   }

We can see that the only difference is that each of the top synthesis Manifest.py points to its specific Verilog/VHDL top module describing the interface for the constrained FPGA design. The other Manifest.py variables are common for both languages and they means:

- ``action``: indicates that this is a synthesis process
- ``syn_device``: indicates the specific FPGA device
- ``syn_family``: indicates the specific FPGA family
- ``syn_grade``: indicates the specific FPGA speed grade
- ``syn_package``: indicates the specific FPGA package
- ``syn_top``: indicates the name of the top HDL instance/module to be synthesized.
- ``syn_project``: indicates the name of the FPGA project that is going to be created.
- ``syn_tool``: indicates the specific synthesis tool that is going to be used.

Now, in order to generate the bitstream for our board, we just get into the folder containing the specific top Manifest.py for synthesis and run ``hdlmake`` without arguments to create the desired ``Makefile``, e.g. for VHDL:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ cd counter/syn/spec_v4_ise/vhdl
   user@host:~$ hdlmake

So, once ``hdlmake`` has already generated the Makefile, issuing a simple ``make`` command is enough to synthesize a valid bitstream. Then, we can issue a clean target for make in order to erase the most of the intermediate generated stuff and even a mrproper one to remove everything included the generated bitstreams.

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~$ make
   user@host:~$ make clean
   user@host:~$ make mrproper

Note that ``hdlmake`` and the examples included in the ``counter`` test have been designed in order to be regular across the different toolchains. In this way, every top Manifest.py for synthesis in the ``syn`` folder can be executed to build a valid bitstream by using the same command sequence we have seen in this section.


Handling remote modules
-----------------------

Let's take a simple example of how ``hdlmake`` handles repositories. 

First, consider that we have a project consisting on four HDL modules and one testbench. The project root folder looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   user@host:~/test/proj$ tree -d
   .
   `-- hdl
       |-- module1
       |-- module2
       |-- module3
       |-- module4
       `-- tb

Supposing that all of the modules are local to the development machine, i.e. the contents of the modules are available in the local host, the ``Manifest.py``  in ``tb`` directory should look like this:

.. code-block:: python

   modules = {
       "local":["../module1","../module2","../module3","../module4"]
   }

We only have the ``local`` key and an asociated four elements list containing the path to the respective local folders where the modules are stored.

This case was very trivial. Let's try now to complicate the situation a bit. Let say, ``module1`` is stored as a local module, ``module2`` and ``module3`` are stored in remote **SVN** repositories, and ``module4`` is stored in a **GIT** repository. Here we have how a sample module declaration including remote repositories would look like:

.. code-block:: python

   modules = {
       "local": "../module1"
       "svn":[
           "http://path.to.repo/module2",
           "http://path.to.repo/module3@25"
       ],
       "git":"git@github.com:user/module4.git"
   }

Now we can see that the ``local`` key just has an associated path (i.e. this is a 1-element list), while we have two additional key identifiers: ``svn``, pointing to a list of two remote SVN repositories, and ``git``, pointing to a single remote GIT repository.

Regarding the SVN repositories, ``module2`` is pointing to the ``default/head`` revision while ``module3`` SVN repository is pointing to revision number 25 by appending the ``@25`` sufix to the repository URL..

Finally, the Git repository ``module4`` is the only entry for the GIT module list and it is pointing to the ``default/master`` branch, but we can introduce the following extra modifiers to force a specific ``branch``, ``tag`` or ``commit``:

* [ ``::`` ] | Point to a specific branch (e.g. "develop")

.. code-block:: python

       # e.g.: target branch is "develop"
       "git":"git@github.com:user/module4.git::develop"


* [ ``@@`` ] | Point to a specific tag  or commit

.. code-block:: python

       # e.g.: target tag is "v1.0"
       "git":"git@github.com:user/module4.git@@v1.0"

       # e.g.: target commit is "a964df3d84f84ef1f87acb300c4946d8c33e526a"
       "git":"git@github.com:user/module4.git@@a964df3d84f84ef1f87acb300c4946d8c33e526a"

.. note:: if the requested Git repository is declared as a ``git submodule`` too and we do not provide an extra ``::`` or ``@@``  modifier in the ``Manifest.py``, ``hdlmake`` will read the desired commit id from the respective submodule declaration and will checkout this code revision right after the repository is cloned.

Now, if we run the ``hdlmake fetch`` command from inside the folder where the top Manifest.py is stored, hdlmake will read the local, SVN and GIT module lists and will automatically clone/fetch the remote SVN and GIT repositories. The only issue is that the modules would be fetched to the directory in which we are placed, which is not very elegant. To make the process more flexible, we can add the ``fetchto`` option to the manifest in order to point to the actual folder in which we want to store our remotely hosted modules.

.. code-block:: python

   fetchto = "../../ip_cores"



Custom Makefile commands
--------------------------------------------

As we have already seen in the simulation example, ``hdlmake`` allows for the injection of optional external shell commands that
are executed just before and/or just after the selected action has been executed. By using this feature, we can automate other custom tasks
in addition to the ``hdlmake`` specific ones.

If a external command has been defined in the top Manifest, this is automatically written by ``hdlmake`` into the generated Makefile.
In this way, the external commands are automatically executed in order when a ``make`` command is issued.


Synthesis commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the tool you are going to use, you'll be able to run specific pre/post commands for all the available fine grained synthesis targets: ``{project, synthesize, translate, map, par, bitstream}``. This is how these custom commands works:

- ``syn_pre_<stage>_cmd``: this command is executed before executing the ``<stage>`` synthesis step.
- ``syn_post_<stage>_cmd``: this command is executed after executing the ``<stage>`` synthesis step.

+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| Name                     | Type         | Description                                                     | Default   |
+==========================+==============+=================================================================+===========+
| syn_pre_project_cmd      | str          | Command to be executed before synthesis: project                | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_post_project_cmd     | str          | Command to be executed after synthesis: project                 | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_pre_synthesize_cmd   | str          | Command to be executed before synthesis: synthesize             | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_post_synthesize_cmd  | str          | Command to be executed after synthesis: synthesize              | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_pre_translate_cmd    | str          | Command to be executed before synthesis: translate              | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_post_translate_cmd   | str          | Command to be executed after synthesis: translate               | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_pre_map_cmd          | str          | Command to be executed before synthesis: map                    | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_post_map_cmd         | str          | Command to be executed after synthesis: map                     | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_pre_par_cmd          | str          | Command to be executed before synthesis: par                    | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_post_par_cmd         | str          | Command to be executed after synthesis: par                     | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_pre_bitstream_cmd    | str          | Command to be executed before synthesis: bitstream              | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| syn_post_bitstream_cmd   | str          | Command to be executed after synthesis: bitstream               | ''        |
+--------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+


As a very simple example, we can introduce in the ``Manifest.py`` from a Xilinx ISE design a *hello world!* command that will be executed just before the first synthesis target (``project``) and a *bye, bye world!* that will be executed just after the last synthesis target (``bitstream``):

.. code-block:: python

   target = "xilinx"
   action = "synthesis"

   syn_device = "xc6slx45t"
   syn_grade = "-3"
   syn_package = "fgg484"
   syn_top = "spec_top"
   syn_project = "demo.xise"
   syn_tool = "ise"

   syn_pre_project_cmd = "echo hello world!"
   syn_post_bitstream_cmd = "echo bye, bye world!"

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../top/spec_v4/verilog" ],
   }


Simulation commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, if we want to add external commands to a simulation top makefile, the following parameters must be introduced:

+----------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| Name           | Type         | Description                                                     | Default   |
+================+==============+=================================================================+===========+
| sim_pre_cmd    | str          | Command to be executed before simulation                        | None      |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| sim_post_cmd   | str          | Command to be executed after simulation                         | None      |
+----------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+

As a very simple example, we can introduce both extra commands in the top simulation makefile we have previously seen:

.. code-block:: python

   action = "simulation"
   sim_tool = "modelsim"
   sim_top = "counter_tb"

   sim_pre_cmd = "echo This is executed just before the simulation"
   sim_post_cmd = "echo This is executed just after the simulation"

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../testbench/counter_tb/verilog" ],
   }


Multiline commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to execute a more complex action from the pre/post synthesis/simulation commands, you can point to an
external shell script or program. As an alternative, you can use a multiline string in order to inject multiple
commands into the Makefile.

As a first option, multiple commands can be launched by spliting a single long string into one piece per command.
The drawback for this approach is that the original single line is reconstructed an inserted into the Makefile, so
the specific external command Makefile target include just a single entry. This is why, in the following example,
semicolons are used in order to separate the sequential commands: 

.. code-block:: python

   syn_pre_cmd = (
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test1;" 
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test2;" 
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test3;" 
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test4;" 
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test5" 
   )

A cleaner alternative, is using a multiline text in which line return and tabulation characters has been introduced
in order to separate in different lines each of the commans when they are written into the Makefiles. In the 
following example, this approach is exemplified:

.. code-block:: python

   syn_pre_cmd = (
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test1\n\t\t" 
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test2\n\t\t" 
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test3\n\t\t" 
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test4\n\t\t" 
       "mkdir /home/user/Workspace/test5" 
   )


Custom variables and conditional execution
------------------------------------------

In order to give an extra level of flexibility when defining the files and modules that are going to be used in a
specific project, ``hdlmake`` allows for the introduction of custom Python variables and code in the ``Manifest.py`` hierarchy.
This is a very handy feature when different synthesis
or simulation configurations in complex designs should be selected from the top level Manifest when running ``hdlmake``.

As a very simple example of how this mechanism can be used, suppose that we want to simulate a design that uses a module for which
two different harware descriptions are available, one in VHDL and one in Verilog (mixed language is a common feature of commercial
simulation tools and is an under-development feature for Icarus Verilog).

For this purpose, we introduce an ``if`` clause inside a children Manifest in which the ``simulate_vhdl`` boolean variable
is used to select the content of the following ``modules`` to be scanned:

.. code-block:: python

   if simulate_vhdl:
       print("We are using the VHDL module")
       modules = {
           "local" : [ "../../../modules/counter/vhdl" ],
       }
   else:
       print("We are using the Verilog module")
       modules = {
           "local" : [ "../../../modules/counter/verilog" ],
       }

Now, in order to define the ``simulate_vhdl`` variable value, we can use two different approachs. 
The first one is to include this as a new variable in the top Manifest.py, i.e.:

.. code-block:: python

   action = "simulation"
   sim_tool = "modelsim"
   sim_top = "counter_tb"

   simulate_vhdl = False

   modules = {
       "local" : [ "../../../testbench/counter_tb/verilog" ],
   }

But we can also define the variable value by injecting custom prefix or sufix Python code from the command line
when ``hdlmake`` is executed, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   hdlmake --sufix "simulate_vhdl = False" makefile




Advanced examples
-----------------

Xilinx ISE
~~~~~~~~~~

As a non-trivial design example of a real use case of ``hdlmake`` with  Xilinx ISE, we have chosen the **White Rabbit PTP Core** reference design the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) provides for the **Simple PCIe FMC Carrier (SPEC)**. This open-hardware platform is powered by a **Xilinx Spartan-6** and is used in multiple experimental physics facilities around the world.

- WR PTP Core: http://www.ohwr.org/projects/wr-cores/wiki/Current_release
- Simple PCIe FMC Carrier: http://www.ohwr.org/projects/spec/wiki

In the following instructions, we will see how easy is to build the bitstream from the command line (**tested on both Windows and Linux hosts**).

We start by cloning the repository and getting into the SPEC reference design (**tested with Release v4.0**):

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git://ohwr.org/hdl-core-lib/wr-cores.git
   cd wr-cores/syn/spec_ref_design/

Now, the WR PTP Core requires a series of HDL libraries that are provided under ``hdlmake`` format in the CERN Open Hardware repository. In this example, you have the option of fetching all of the dependencies for all of the reference designs provided in the downloaded source code by using the ``git submodule`` mechanism, this is:

.. code-block:: bash

   git submodule init
   git submodule update

Alternatively, if you only want to download the design submodule dependencies the design needs, we can use the ``hdlmake fetch`` feature as the required remote modules are already listed in the provided ``Manifest.py``. As the ``Git`` remote  modules directives doesn't point to a specific branch or commit id, ``hdlmake`` will only clone the listed repositories in the ``fetchto`` folder and then will checkout the appropriated commits by previously interrogating the ``git submodule`` mechanism.

.. code-block:: bash

   hdlmake fetch

Once we have all the dependencies, we can run ``hdlmake`` to automatically generate a synthesis ``Makefile``. Once we have done this, we can just run Make to automatically generate the bitstream:

.. code-block:: bash

   hdlmake
   make

If you experience any problem, please perform a **make clean** before running ``Make``. The synthesis should run fine after doing this -- the design comes out of the box with an Xilinx ``*.ise`` project created with ``hdlmake 2.1``, while in ``hdlmake 3.0`` the synthesis project file is created by the ``Makefile``.

If you want to regenerate the ISE project by using your **custom Xilinx ISE properties**, you may replace the provided ``Manifest.py`` with the following one and edit it accordingly. By using this code, you can exactly reproduce the CERN's team setup:

.. code-block:: python

   target = "xilinx"
   action = "synthesis"

   syn_device = "xc6slx45t"
   syn_grade = "-3"
   syn_package = "fgg484"
   syn_top = "spec_wr_ref_top"
   syn_project = "spec_wr_ref.xise"
   syn_tool = "ise"
   syn_properties = [
       ["Auto Implementation Compile Order", "false"],
       ["Manual Implementation Compile Order", "true"],
       ["Manual Implementation Compile Order", "true"],
       ["Pack I/O Registers/Latches into IOBs", "For Outputs Only"],
       ["Generate Detailed MAP Report", "true"]]

   modules = { "local" : "../../top/spec_ref_design/"}


Xilinx Vivado
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an advanced example for Xilinx Vivado, we have chosen the Beam Position Monitor (BPM) design from the Beam Diagnostics group of the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) for the **AMC FMC Carrier (AFC)**.
When instantiated in a **Xilinx Artix-7** FPGA, it allows to connect the clock source to any clock input.

- BPM Design: https://github.com/lnls-dig/bpm-gw
- AMC FMC Carrier (AFC): http://www.ohwr.org/projects/afc/wiki


In the following instructions, we will see how easy is to build the bitstream from the command line (**tested on both Windows and Linux hosts**).

We start by cloning the repository and getting into the AFC reference design:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/lnls-dig/bpm-gw.git
   cd bpm-gw/hdl/syn/afc_v3/vivado/dbe_bpm2/

Now, the Beam Position Monitor requires a series of HDL libraries that are provided under ``hdlmake`` format in both the CERN Open Hardware repository and GitHub. In this example, you have the option of fetching all of the dependencies for all of the reference designs provided in the downloaded source code by using the ``git submodule`` mechanism, this is:

.. code-block:: bash

   git submodule init
   git submodule update

Alternatively, if you only want to download the design submodule dependencies the design needs, we can use the ``hdlmake fetch``, but we will need to modify the ``bpm-gw/hdl/Manifest.py`` so that its new content is:

.. code-block:: python

   fetchto = "ip_cores"

   modules = { "local": ["modules/dbe_wishbone",
                         "modules/dbe_common",
                         "modules/fabric",
                         "modules/fmc_adc_common",
                         "modules/utils",
                         "modules/pcie",
                         "platform"],
               "git" : [ "git://ohwr.org/hdl-core-lib/etherbone-core.git",
                         "https://github.com/lnls-dig/general-cores.git",
                         "https://github.com/lnls-dig/dsp-cores.git" ] }


.. note:: In order to allow the use of IP-XACT IP Core libraries for Vivado, the ``fetcho`` variable in the ``Manifest.py`` hierarchy is not only used as the folder to store remote ``hdlmake`` modules, but it's automatically assigned as the value for the ``ip_repo_paths`` Vivado project property.

Once this is done, ``hdlmake`` will only clone the listed repositories in the ``fetchto`` folder and then will checkout the appropriated commits by previously interrogating the ``git submodule`` mechanism. In this example, doing

.. code-block:: bash

   hdlmake fetch

Once we have all the dependencies, we can run ``hdlmake`` to automatically generate a synthesis ``Makefile``. Once we have done this, we can just run Make to automatically generate the bitstream:

.. code-block:: bash

   hdlmake
   make


This project makes use of **custom Xilinx Vivado properties** and **custom Python code**, so it is a very valuable example as a template for custom setups. Here, you can see a copy of the top ``Manifest.py`` contents for the BPM design:

.. code-block:: python

   target = "xilinx"
   action = "synthesis"

   syn_device = "xc7a200t"
   syn_grade = "-2"
   syn_package = "ffg1156"
   syn_top = "dbe_bpm2"
   syn_project = "dbe_bpm2"
   syn_tool = "vivado"
   syn_properties = [
       ["steps.synth_design.args.more options", "-verbose"],
       ["steps.synth_design.args.retiming", "1"],
       ["steps.synth_design.args.assert", "1"],
       ["steps.opt_design.args.verbose", "1"],
       ["steps.opt_design.args.directive", "Explore"],
       ["steps.opt_design.is_enabled", "1"],
       ["steps.place_design.args.directive", "Explore"],
       ["steps.place_design.args.more options", "-verbose"],
       ["steps.phys_opt_design.args.directive", "AlternateFlowWithRetiming"],
       ["steps.phys_opt_design.args.more options", "-verbose"],
       ["steps.phys_opt_design.is_enabled", "1"],
       ["steps.route_design.args.directive", "Explore"],
       ["steps.route_design.args.more options", "-verbose"],
       ["steps.post_route_phys_opt_design.args.directive", "AddRetime"],
       ["steps.post_route_phys_opt_design.args.more options", "-verbose"],
       ["steps.post_route_phys_opt_design.is_enabled", "1"],
       ["steps.write_bitstream.args.verbose", "1"]]

   import os
   import sys
   if os.path.isfile("synthesis_descriptor_pkg.vhd"):
       files = ["synthesis_descriptor_pkg.vhd"];
   else:
       sys.exit("Generate the SDB descriptor before using HDLMake (./build_synthesis_sdb.sh)")

   machine_pkg = "uvx_250M";

   modules = { "local" : [ "../../../../top/afc_v3/vivado/dbe_bpm2" ] };



Intel Quartus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the same source code design the CERN provides for the White Rabbit PTP Core, it is also included an example for the **VME FMC Carrier HPC-DDR3 (VFC-HD)**. The VFC-HD is an **Intel Arria V** based VME64x carrier for one High Pin Count (HPC) FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC, VITA 57). It is has six SFP+ transceivers compatible with support for rad-hard GBT links, CERN Beam Synchronous Timing (BST), White Rabbit and Ethernet.

- WR PTP Core: http://www.ohwr.org/projects/wr-cores/wiki/Current_release
- VME FMC Carrier HPC-DDR3 (VFC-HD): http://www.ohwr.org/projects/vfc-hd/wiki

We start by cloning the repository and getting into the VFC-HD reference design (**tested with Release v4.0**):

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git://ohwr.org/hdl-core-lib/wr-cores.git
   cd wr-cores/syn/vfchd_ref_design/

Now, the WR PTP Core requires a series of HDL libraries that are provided under ``hdlmake`` format in the CERN Open Hardware repository. In this example, you have the option of fetching all of the dependencies for all of the reference designs provided in the downloaded source code by using the ``git submodule`` mechanism, this is:

.. code-block:: bash

   git submodule init
   git submodule update

Alternatively, if you only want to download the design submodule dependencies the design needs, we can use the ``hdlmake fetch`` feature as the required remote modules are already listed in the provided ``Manifest.py``. As the ``Git`` remote modules directives doesn't point to a specific branch or commit id, ``hdlmake`` will only clone the listed repositories in the ``fetchto`` folder and then will checkout the appropriate commits by previously interrogating the ``git submodule`` mechanism.

.. code-block:: bash

   hdlmake fetch

Once we have all the dependencies, we can run ``hdlmake`` to automatically generate a synthesis ``Makefile``. Once we have done this, we can just run Make to automatically generate the bitstream:

.. code-block:: bash

   hdlmake
   make

It's important to know that this design relies on versioned Intel IP-Cores, so it will only work just out of the box with the appropriate Intel Quartus version (**WR PTP Core v4.0 requires Intel Quartus 16.0**).

If you want to use a different Intel Quartus version, you will need to fix the IP-Core versions. This is an example patch for **upgrading  WR PTP Core v4.0 from Intel Quartus 16.0 to Intel Quartus 16.1**:

hdlmake supported actions/commands
==================================

Makefile generation (``makefile``)
----------------------------------
This is the default command for ``hdlmake`` and its basic behaviour will be defined by the value of the ``action`` manifest parameter in the hierarchy ``Manifest.py``. ``action`` can be set to ``simulation`` or ``synthesis``, and the associated command sequence will be:

- **simulation**: generate a simulation makefile including all the files required for the defined testbench
- **synthesis**: generate a synthesis makefile including all the files required for bitstream generation

By using the ``-f FILENAME``, ``--filename FILENAME`` optional argument for the ``makefile`` command, we can choose the name of the synthesis or simulation Makefile that will be generated by ``hdlmake``.

In order to allow for a more agile development, we have included these shortcuts when using the ``hdlmake makefile`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   # These commands are equivalent
   hdlmake makefile
   hdlmake

   # These commands are equivalent
   hdlmake makefile -f FILENAME
   hdlmake -f FILENAME

.. note:: in any case, it's supposed that all the required modules have been previously fetched. Otherwise, the process will fail.


Fetching submodules for a top module (``fetch``)
------------------------------------------------               
Fetch and/or update remote modules listed in Manifest. It is assumed that a projects can consist of modules, that are stored in different places (locally or a repo). The same thing is about each of those modules - they can be based on other modules. Hdlmake can fetch all of them and store them in specified places. For each module one can specify a target catalog with manifest variable ``fetchto``. Its value must be a name (existent or not) of a folder. The folder may be located anywhere in the filesystem. It must be then a relative path (``hdlmake`` support solely relative paths).

Cleaning the fetched repositories (``clean``)
---------------------------------------------
remove all modules fetched for direct and indirect children of this module

List modules (``list-mods``)
----------------------------
List all the modules involved in the design described by the top manifest and its children hierarchy. The output list will be printed in stdout, being each of the modules represented by a single text line made up of two entries separated by a tab. The first entry in a line associated to a module is the relative path to the specific directory where the module is stored, while the second entry is a identifier indicating the origin of the module.

.. note:: the hierarchy will be built considering that the Manifest.py stored in the folder from which we all launching the command is the root one.

If we provide the ``--with-files`` argument to ``list-mods``, the files being directly included by a specific module will be printed just after the line pointing to this specific module. Each of the printed lines associated to a file will be composed by two entries too, the first one pointing to the relative path to the file and the second one indicating that the resource is a file.

In addition to the lines representing modules and files, ``list-mods`` will also print to standard output some comments providing additional information about the structure of the module hierarchy. This modules will start with a ``#`` sign, following in this way the usual shell convention. By providing the ``--terse`` argument to ``list-mods``, the comment lines won't be printed to stdout, being only printed those lines representing an actual resource (module or file).

Summing everything up, the following table compiles the different kind of resources that can be printed when listing the modules:

+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code               | Origin                                                                    |
+====================+===========================================================================+
| ``local``          | this module is stored in the local host                                   |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``git``            | this is a module hosted in a GIT repository                               |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``svn``            | this is a module hosted in a SVN repository                               |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``file``           | this is a file (included by the module that has been previously printed)  |
+--------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now, here we have some examples of the outputs we should expect when using the ``list-mods`` command:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   user@host:~/hdl-make/tests/counter/syn/spec_v4_ise/vhdl$ hdlmake list-mods --with-files
   # MODULE START -> git@ohwr.org:misc/hdl-make.git
   # * This is the root module
   .	local
   # * This module has no files
   # MODULE END -> git@ohwr.org:misc/hdl-make.git

   # MODULE START -> /home/javi/Workspace/hdl-make-test/tests/counter/top/spec_v4/vhdl
   # * The parent for this module is: git@ohwr.org:misc/hdl-make.git
   ../../../top/spec_v4/vhdl	local
   ../../../top/spec_v4/spec_top.ucf	file
   ../../../top/spec_v4/vhdl/spec_top.vhd	file
   # MODULE END -> /home/javi/Workspace/hdl-make-test/tests/counter/top/spec_v4/vhdl

   # MODULE START -> /home/javi/Workspace/hdl-make-test/tests/counter/modules/counter/vhdl
   # * The parent for this module is: /home/javi/Workspace/hdl-make-test/tests/counter/top/spec_v4/vhdl
   ../../../modules/counter/vhdl	local
   ../../../modules/counter/vhdl/counter.vhd	file
   # MODULE END -> /home/javi/Workspace/hdl-make-test/tests/counter/modules/counter/vhdl


   user@host:~/hdl-make/tests/counter/syn/spec_v4_ise/vhdl$ hdlmake list-mods --with-files --terse
   .	local
   ../../../top/spec_v4/vhdl	local
   ../../../top/spec_v4/spec_top.ucf	file
   ../../../top/spec_v4/vhdl/spec_top.vhd	file
   ../../../modules/counter/vhdl	local
   ../../../modules/counter/vhdl/counter.vhd	file


   user@host:~/hdl-make/tests/counter/syn/spec_v4_ise/vhdl$ hdlmake list-mods --terse
   .	local
   ../../../top/spec_v4/vhdl	local
   ../../../modules/counter/vhdl	local


List files (``list-files``)
---------------------------
List all the files that are defined inside all of the modules included in the hierachy in the form of a string of elements separated by a DELIMITER and print this list to stdout.

The DELIMITER is defaulted to a white space, but it can be defined by using the ``--delimiter DELIMITER`` argument for the ``list-files`` command.

.. note:: the file list will be built considering that the Manifest.py stored in the folder from which we are launching the command is the root one.

In order to build the file list, ``hdlmake`` will parse the HDL files to find the required dependencies that a **top entity** needs to be successfuly compiled. We can configure the name of the HDL module that will be considered as the top entity to build the required file hierarchy by using the ``--top TOP`` optional argument to the ``list-files`` command. If no top entity is defined, all of the design files will be listed.

Finally, by using the ``--reverse`` optional argument we are able to reverse the order of the listed files.

.. _args:

Optional arguments for ``hdlmake``
==================================

Hdlmake can be run with several arguments. The way of using them is identical with the standard one in Linux systems. The order of the arguments is not important. Hereafter you can find each argument with a short description.

``-h, --help``
--------------
Shows help message that is automatically generated with Python's optparse module. Gives a short description of each available option.


``-v, --version``
--------------
Print the version of the ``hdlmake`` instance on execution an quit.


``--log LOG``
-------------
Set logging level for the Python logger facility. You can choose one of the levels in the following tables, in which the associated internal logging numeric value is also included:

+---------------+---------------+
| Log Level     | Numeric Value |
+===============+===============+
| ``critical``  | 50            |
+---------------+---------------+
| ``error``     | 40            |
+---------------+---------------+
| ``warning``   | 30            |
+---------------+---------------+
| ``info``      | 20            |
+---------------+---------------+
| ``debug``     | 10            |
+---------------+---------------+
| not provided  | 0             |
+---------------+---------------+


``-p, --prefix ARBITRARY_CODE``
-------------------------------
Add arbitrary Python code from the command line that **will be evaluated before each Manifest.py** parse action across the hierarchy.

As an example, this command will generate the Makefile and will try to print ``Hello hdlmake`` before each ``Manifest.py`` run:

.. code-block:: bash

   hdlmake -p "print('Hello hdlmake')"


``-s, --sufix ARBITRARY_CODE``
------------------------------
Add arbitrary Python code from the command line that **will be evaluated after each Manifest.py** parse action across the hierarchy.

As an example, this command will generate the Makefile but will try to print ``Bye, bye hdlmake`` after each ``Manifest.py`` run:

.. code-block:: bash

   hdlmake -s "print('Bye, bye hdlmake')"
